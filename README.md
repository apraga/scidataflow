# SciFlow

There is a fundamental other valuable asset in modern science other than that
paper. It is a reproducible, reusable set of project data.

Science has several problems, and I think the most severe of which is that
manuscripts have extremely limited value in terms of our long-term
understanding of complex phenomenon. Science needs to build of previous work
organically, so that lineages of work on one topic can rely on the same,
robust shared assets.

What is ProjectData? 

ProjectData are sort of like supplementary material, except instead of being
stored in a PDF that is hard to access, it is immediately accessible from
anywhere with the commands:

    git clone https://github.com/scientist_anne/research_project.git
    cd research_project/
    scf status

    sci pull  # pull in all the project data.
